    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An air fryer can bake up a few cookies in about half the time an oven
      takes, and it doesn't need much time for preheating. Plus, you'll still
      get the same texture and flavor you're looking for!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg, room temperature, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix all ingredients. Roll level tablespoons of dough
        into balls. Flatten with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat air fryer to 400Â°. In batches, place 1 in. apart in greased air
        fryer. Cook until lightly browned, 3-4 minutes. Allow to cool slightly
        on the pan and remove to wire racks to cool.
